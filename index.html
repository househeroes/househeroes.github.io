                        We all know what it's like to have a messy shower. We all have learned a particular way to clean it up as well. Some of the things we've found have worked for us and others, have simply not. After a long week behind us... [read more]</p></a>

                        <p>
                            In short, a hero is "a mythological or legendary figure often of divine descent endowed with great strength or ability" [Merriam-Webster]. We love our Employees and we hope they serve you well. Wether you're just looking to clean up your house before a big move, or have a clean house to move into, or just need a little help fitting having a clean home into your busy schedule, we will be there to help you. We walk into dream homes going through a nightmare stage with no fear, and no compromise. Let us do the work, and it will get done with efficiency, effectiveness, pride, and a smile.

                        <p>
                            Yes, we have competitors. We've seen them. Walking out of their car with a feather-duster and some all purpose spray. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We walk into a job with a team, a Sebo vacuum, spray bottles, multipurpose cleaner, 4-5 different types of Norwex rags, a Norwex mop (dry and wet), buckets, brushes, furniture polishes, stainless steel cleaner, scrub pads, and KNEE PADS! But, you will <em>never</em> see us with a duster. Dusters just move stuff around. Our goal walking in is to get all the dust into either the vacuum or the cleaning bucket and then getting it out of your house for good.
