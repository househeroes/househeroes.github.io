                                We all know what it's like to have a messy shower. We all have learned a particular way to clean it up as well. Some of the things we've found have worked for us and others, have simply not. After a long week behind us and a weekend full of company ahead, it's SO easy to think that giving it the works, works. It's so easy to imagine the bleach or ammonia eating away at the bacteria while the kids show off their new surprise picture for you consisting of: crayons, elbow macaroni, apple juice, mud and lots and lots of love, posted right up there on the wall for Grandma and Grandpa to see later. They may not know that "the wall was fine just the way it was"...
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At House Heroes, we have this picture in mind. And, we want you to know it. Look, in all honesty chemicals are great for killing bacteria in the short term. However, it kills all bacteria and then often dries with an even harder to remove residue. This residue stays on until it comes off later (on you) to be absorbed into your body. We picture cleaning with chemicals and see a <em>toxic playground</em> of immune system compromising agents all over the floor, the bathroom, the banisters, walls, kitchen and dining room... causing even more <em>allergic irritation</em> and <em>mental anguish</em> than a <em>dirty room</em>. And, we simply say "no".

                                Just, no.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For this reason we elect to use a select few non-toxic cleaners when we delve in to cleaning because we care about our customers. We clean your house just as we would clean our own before company arrives. With care and consideration not just for the appearance of our humble abode's, but for our bodily health and wellness as well. A good cleanse done right can lift the spirits of an atmosphere in an instant, leaving your home with a welcoming and warm vibe and look for all who visit [back to homepage]
